This project involved a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for a California-based telecommunications company. The goal was to leverage data to understand the underlying patterns and drivers of customer attrition.
Using Power BI for the entire data pipeline, from cleaning and transformation to modeling and visualization, the analysis synthesized customer demographic, service, and billing data. The final output is an interactive dashboard that provides stakeholders with clear insights into churn dynamics, enabling data-driven decision-making for retention strategies.
