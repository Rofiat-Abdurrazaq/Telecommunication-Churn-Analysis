1. Introduction
This project analyzes customer churn data for a California-based telecommunications company serving over 7,000 customers. Customer churn represents a critical business challenge, directly impacting revenue, marketing ROI, and long-term growth. The analysis identifies patterns in customer behavior, service usage, and demographic factors to understand why customers leave and provide data-driven strategies for retention.

2. Project Description
The project scope covers comprehensive customer data analysis across multiple dimensions including demographics, service types, billing methods, and geographic distribution. The approach involved data exploration, descriptive analytics, correlation analysis, and visualization to address specific business questions that align with stakeholder requirements. The analysis connects customer behavioral data with service characteristics to identify churn drivers.

3. Project Aim
To identify the primary drivers of customer churn, segment at-risk customer profiles, quantify the financial impact of churn, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce customer attrition.

4. About the Dataset
Source: STC database
Record Count: 7,043 rows and 38 columns customers for the telecommunication churn table and for zipcode 1671 rows and two columns
Key Fields/Columns:
•	Customer demographics (gender, marital status, location)
•	Service details (internet type, contract type, monthly charges)
•	Payment information (payment method, paperless billing)
•	Tenure and status (customer lifetime, churn status)
•	Total Revenue (total revenue, ARPU(Average annual Revenue Per User), churn revenue)
•	Geographic data (cities, performance by location)

5. Tools Used
•	Power BI – For data cleaning, validation, modelling, normalization, interactive dashboard creation and visualization.

6. Importing the Dataset
Data (“telecom customer churn and the telecom zip population” tables) were extracted from STC database in CSV format then imported into Power BI. Before loading the data was transformed in power query for cleaning, normalizing, then relationships were created between the customer details and zip code table and then loaded for interactive dashboard development. 

7. Data Cleaning & Transformation
•	Categorical Inputation (Non-Churned Customers): Null entries within the Churn Category with “Customers” since they had the status of stayed and joined which means they are still existing customers and Churn Reason columns were replaced with the descriptive value "N/A". This decision reflects the business logic that an empty value in these specific fields signifies the customer is still active.
•	Numerical Imputation (Zero Replacement): Null values in quantitative fields, such as “Avg monthly GB download”, were systematically replaced using the zero-inputation method.
•	Created calculated fields: Generated churn flags, tenure segments, and revenue categories
•	Validated geographic data: Standardized city names and coordinated with zip code database

8. Data Modeling
Power BI Relationships: After data transformation and normalization, the data was modelled by joining the fact table (telecom customer churn) was joined with the dimension table (telecom_zip_population) on the zip code with a one-to -many relationship

DAX Measures:
•	Churn rate: Calculate the percentage of customers who churned
•	Churn Revenue: Total amount of revenue lost due to churning
•	Total Customers: Counts the total number of customers.
•	Average revenue per user: Generates the average revenue for users

9. Data Analysis

•	Service performance by type (Fiber Optic, DSL, Cable)
•	Contract type analysis (month-to-month vs. term contracts)
•	Payment method correlation with churn
•	Customer tenure segmentation and churn patterns
•	Geographic performance across 1,106 cities
•	Revenue impact by customer segment ($3.68M churn revenue)

11. Key Insights
Demographic & Contract Insights:
•	Married customers represent 64% of churned customers, indicating family decision-making impacts retention
•	Month-to-month contract holders are 3x more likely to churn than customers with annual contracts
•	New customers (0-3 months tenure) show the highest churn volume, revealing onboarding issues
Service & Product Insights:
•	Fiber Optic internet customers account for 66% of all churns (1,236 customers), indicating critical service quality issues
•	Customers without Online Security services are 40% more likely to churn
•	Electronic payment users (Bank Withdrawal, Credit Card) represent 92% of churned customers
Financial & Geographic Insights:
•	Top revenue cities (Los Angeles, San Diego) also generate the highest churn volume, representing maximum financial risk
•	The 17.24% revenue churn rate indicates loss of high-value customers
•	ARPU of $3,034.38 suggests significant revenue opportunity in retaining at-risk customers

12. Recommendations
Immediate Actions (0-3 months):
•	Launch targeted retention campaign for Month-to-Month Fiber Optic customers in major metropolitan areas
•	Implement "First 90 Days" onboarding program with proactive support check-ins
•	Create contract conversion incentives to move high-risk customers to annual agreements
Strategic Initiatives (3-12 months):
•	Conduct comprehensive Fiber Optic service quality review and infrastructure assessment
•	Develop bundled service packages including Online Security to increase customer stickiness
•	Redesign billing communications for paperless billing customers to enhance engagement
Long-term Transformations (12+ months):
•	Build predictive churn modeling capability for proactive intervention
•	Establish cross-functional churn task force with representatives from product, support, and marketing
•	Implement customer success metrics tied to executive compensation

13. Conclusion
The analysis reveals that churn is primarily driven by service quality issues in Fiber Optic internet, exacerbated by flexible contract terms that enable easy cancellation. The financial impact is substantial at $3.68M annually, with particular concentration in high-value urban markets. By implementing the recommended strategies focused on service improvement, contract stabilization, and targeted retention, the company can potentially reduce churn by 25% and recover approximately $900,000 in annual revenue while strengthening customer loyalty in core markets.
